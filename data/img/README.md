# Image Data

`radiology-cv/data/img` is a placeholder directory for holding transformed contents of the [Japanese Society of Radiological Technology (JSRT) Standard Digital Image Database](http://www.jsrt.or.jp/jsrt-db/eng.php).

The database contains 247 chest radiographs. The majority of these x-ray images feature the presence of a pulmonary nodule. However, not all are malignant. For more information, please consult the [JSRT Database User's Guide](../../docs/DB_UsersGuide2008.pdf).

## IMPORTANT

These radiographs are intentionally not included in this repository to protect the privacy of patients. However, the images can be obtained directly from [JSRT]() under the condition that they be used solely for research purposes
